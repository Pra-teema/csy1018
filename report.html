 <br>GETTING STARTED<br>
       <p>In order to create the Portfolio of mine I researched about how the CV of mine should<br>
    	look like as I didn't have any idea about the layout and the design of the sites and <br>
    	what content and features should be added to look the design better and attractive.<br>
    	So,during my research I found almost every of the websites  attractive and user friendly<br>
    	featuring different animations,transitions and hover effects.But I also found that most<br>
    	of the websites designs were made using the bootstraps and the Javascript.And as per the<br>
    	requirement given to make the websites design I have to use HTML5 and CSS3 property in my <br>
    	websites rather than Bootstraps and Javascript.So,through different  websites I learned <br>
    	different HTML and CSS property.</p><br>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF WEBSITES</h3>
<h4>Design of my Homepage</h4>
<p>This is my landing page ,the homepage in which in the left top of navigation bar I have<br>
   written my name and in the right top I have Home,Profile,CV,Social,Contact <br>
   and Models.gp.When the arrow is placed	near the different navigation then it<br>
    hovers back and I have also fixed the position of Navigation Bar and the footer. <br>
   And in the middle section part I have inserted the photo of mine.</p><br>
  <img src="image/h1.jpg" alt="homepage">



<h4>Design of my About page</h4>

   	the position of the header and the footer.In the section part I have divided the section into <br>
   	two equal different blocks where in the left blockI have attached my photo and in the right <br>
   	block contains my short biography.</p><br>
   	<img src="image/h3.jpg" alt="about page">

 <h4>Design of my Social page</h4>
  <p>Social page of my website is simple .Below the navigation bar I have made the division class below which<br>
   the different social media sites as per the given requirement like facebook,twitter,github,linkedin,reddit<br>

<h3>EVIDENCE OF USING MODELS OF GP</h3>
<h4>Visual appeal</h4>
<p>Before creating the websites of mine I have looked many websites and portfolio pages<br>
  wherethe color combination were user friendly and websites were attractive.And I have<br>
 also asked a aid from friends forthe idea and opinions about different contents which <br>
  I should add or not to make the websites attractive and user friendly.<br>
</p>


<h4>Navigation</h4>
<p>The navigation bar should be simple with few hover effects so that whenever <br>
	the user use the navigationbar it should attract the user .In the websites <br>
	I have kept the navigation bar at the top so that user can see at the <br>
	first sight.They may not feel bored to search the navigation bar<br></p>

<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
<p>I have made six different page in my websites where in the<br>
	first page there is a homepage.The homepage is simple with my <br>
	photo in the middle . In the second page there is about<br>
	page,which describes about me In the third there is CV page <br>
	In the fourth page there is a social page  ,in the fifth there<br>
	is a contact page and in the last page there is models.gp page<br>
    where I have written the report of my whole assignment<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	During this assignment,I have learned many more ideas about how the websites<br>
	should look like and what features are necessary to add inorder to make the<br>
	design look more attractive and user friendly.Not only this I have also learned<br>
	about the different HTML and CSS property.<p>
